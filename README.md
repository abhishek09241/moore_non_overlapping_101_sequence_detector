# moore_non_overlapping_101_sequence_detector
This project implements a Moore state machine to detect non-overlapping occurrences of the binary sequence '101'. It demonstrates the design of an efficient sequence detection system applicable in digital signal processing and serves as a hands-on exploration of finite state machine principles.
